# Lead Sqr Front end Project

## Installation

Node.js installation is needed in order to use `npx` through `npm` to install **React**

```bash
npx create-react-app <project-name> --template typescript
npm start
npm install sass
```

Note: Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. To be 100% sure you use `npm` instead of `yarn` run the command below:

```bash
npx create-react-app <project-name> --template typescript --use-npm
```

If you want to follow along the project, click on the branch drop-down and you will see a list of dropdown branches.

## Clone Project

You can clone or download the zip file from the **green code button** with a dropdown or [click the link here](https://github.com/techstackmedia/lendsqr-fe-test/archive/refs/heads/master.zip). Extract the file in your folder and you are good to go.

Note: The green code button won't be seen for tab screen size or lesser. [Click the link to download the zip file](https://github.com/techstackmedia/lendsqr-fe-test/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) for smaller screens less than 768 pixel `<768px`.

```bash

npm install
git checkout <branch-name>
```

To see all the project branches remotely run the code:

```bash
git branch -r
```

Note: Git must be installed for commands to work. Check if Git is installed with the command `git --version`. If it is already available on PC the version will show up. If you get an error, [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your PC.

## Deployment

To [deploy the app using Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/nodejs) make sure Heroku is installed on PC. To install Heroku [click the link here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and follow the instructions based on your Operating System. Also make sure you have a file named **Procfile** with no extension in the project root directory. The Procfile must have the text `web: npm start` for it to work. Follow the steps below:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'commit message here'
git push origin <branch-name>
heroku login
heroku create
heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.m0ghjqa.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
git push heroku <branch-name>
```

Note: You do not have to run `npm run build` to have the project in production environment. This will be done automatically by Heroku.

## Heroku Config

If you are using a backend like node, configure the variable by using the command syntax `heroku config:set <VAR_NAME>=<VAR_VALUE>`

For example:

```bash
heroku config:set MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
heroku config:set NODEMAILER_EMAIL=test@example.com
heroku config:set NODEMAILER_PASSWORD=secret
```

## Project Link

You will get a unique random link. To rename the link run the command:

```bash
heroku apps:rename <newname>
```

The link to the made up [project can be found here](https://lendsq.vercel.app/).
